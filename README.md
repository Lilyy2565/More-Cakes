# More Cakes
### What it does
The More Cakes mod adds multiple varieties of cakes into your Minecraft world, such as:

- Chocolate Cake
- Berry Cake
- Plain Icing Cake
- Cake Base

Making cakes in Minecraft now makes more sense with the new way to customise cakes, in vanilla, there was only 1 type of cakes, and it had cherries which seemingly came out of nowhere. Now this mod fixes this as when making a cake instead of getting the icing and cherries for free, you can customise your cake with what you want to add on it, including different flavour icing.
